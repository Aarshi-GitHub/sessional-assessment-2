Leaders should set an example for their teams by creating open and efficient channels for communication. They must also be able to listen actively and speak confidently. Leaders who can effectively communicate their vision, address issues and exchange ideas with their team members are more able to foster a productive work environment.</p>
        <h5>Responsibility</h5>
        <p>Responsibility is one of the most sought-after skills in a leader. Taking responsibility means accepting the consequences of one's actions whether positive or negative.
